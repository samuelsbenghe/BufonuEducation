# Amazing Website

If the VLE were more organized, this website wouldnâ€™t need to exist.

Here, topics are summarized into bite-sized chunks rather than being covered in depth. For clarity and flow, AI is helping to structure the content.

Each module will have its own main page with important information such as assessment details or restrictions, along with submodules for each week or topic.

I will try to update the website with new information as quickly as possible. If the website contains outdated data, please mention me in the WhatsApp group.
